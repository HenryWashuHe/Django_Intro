    <h1>Ordering Notice</h1>
    <p>Dear {{ person_name }},</p>
    <p>Thank you for placing your order from {{ company }}. It is scheduled to ship on {{ ship_date|date:"F j, Y" }}.</p>
    <p>Here are the items you've ordered:</p>
    <ul>
        {% for item in items %}
            <li>{{ item }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% if ordered_warranty %}
<p>Your warranty information will be included in the packaging.</p>
{% else %}
<p>You didn't order a warranty, so you're on your own when the products inevitably stop working.</p>
